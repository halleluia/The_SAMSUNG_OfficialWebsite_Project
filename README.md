# The_SAMSUNG_OfficialWebsite_Project
This project is a imitation of the SAMSUNG official website
Here are the procedures to run this project:
1. Run the index.html file on VSCode to see if the effect of the page is correct. If the page can't work normally, you can check the css and img files in the css and img folder. You have to make sure the paths of all fiels and images are correct;
2. The fonts files in the fonts folder are downloaded form the iconfont.cn which is a free website offered by Tencent and you can download your own fonts files on it and make you decision whether change my fonts files;
3. This project use the flex-layout instead of the normal float-layout to solve the compatibility problem. If you wanna try the float-layout you can replace the grid-flex.css file by grid.css file. The grid.css file is offered in the css folder too.(Notice: the grid.css file is not finished, so you have to complete this file yourself to see the correct effect.)
